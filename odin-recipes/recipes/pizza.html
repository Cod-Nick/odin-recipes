			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
			<p>Remove dough from refrigerator and let come to room 
			temperature in an oiled bowl, for at least one hour.</p>
			<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
			<p>Preheat your oven to 550F, or higher, for at least 30 minutes. 
			If you have a pizza stone, place it in the lower-middle of your oven.			</p>
			<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
			<p>Dust your counter with flour. If making two pizzas, 
			divide your dough in half and cover one of the halves with a kitchen 
			towel while you prepared the first pizza.</p>
			<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
			<p>Using your hands, stretch and shape dough into a 
			20-inch circle (if making one pizza) or 10-inch circle 
			(if making two pizzas). Transfer the dough to a sheet of parchment 
			paper and use your hands or a rolling pin to reshape it, if necessary. 
			If the dough starts to shrink back, let it rest for 5 minutes and then c
			ontinue rolling.</p>
			<p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
			<p>Rush olive oil and season the dough with salt and pepper 
			to taste.Then, spoon the pizza sauce onto the dough, leaving a 
			1-inch border. Top with the cheese and some basil leaves, 
			drizzle more olive oil and season again with a little salt and pepper.</p>
			<p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
			<p>Using a pizza peel (or the back side of a baking sheet), transfer the 
			pizza to the pizza stone. If you don't have a baking stone, bake the pizza 
			right on the baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. 
			Slide the parchment back onto the pizza peel (or back side of a baking sheet) 
			and transfer to your counter.</p>
			<p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
			<p>Serve imediatly!</p>
