My first Webpage, let's brutalism or no...

In this project I will use the skills I've gained to create a very simple html website. 

I will show how to put in Italic, Strong, paragraph. How to put a link to other webpages or insert an image. And for last but not 
less important I will build a simple html structure.

Don't forget to commit!!!
